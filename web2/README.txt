
 | Circular Calendar 2.0 |

Based on Matt Juggins' clock-calendar combo over at CodePen (codepen.io/mattjuggins/pen/WGRRYx).
Modified to remove static weather and daily activity mockups & allow for "easy" modifications.

 | What can I change? |

Currently, the preset configurations are:

Clock Visibility (clock-visibility.css):
	Opaque Clock (default)
	Transparent clock (80%), turns opaque on mouse-over (recommended non-default)
	Transparent clock (50%), turns opaque on mouse-over
	Transparent clock (30%), turns opaque on mouse-over

Clock Position (clock-position.css):
	Center of the screen (default)
	Top right
	Top center
	Top left
	Center right
	Center left
	Bottom right
	Bottom center
	Bottom left

Background:
	background.png (default, why would you use anything worse than PNG for your desktop? Show some self-respect!)


If you want to change to any of these presets, just swap the css files with the one you want.

!!!COPY AND PASTE!!! WallpaperEngine does not validate workshop files, and there is a copy of every preset.

If you have knowledge of CSS, then feel free to go ahead and edit the "Custom" variants bundled with all options.
The Custom files have all the variables that have been edited by the presets, but look like the default.

If you want a custom background, replace the file "background.png".
